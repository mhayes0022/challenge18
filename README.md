# Social Network API

## Description
This purpose of this application was to build the backend for a social media site. It includes functionality to create, update, and delete users, as well as the functionality to get all users at once. You can add different users as 'friends' of another user, and you can remove them again from each other's friend's lists. Each user has 'thoughts', or posts, which are associated with their profiles. This application includes functionality to create, update, and delete thoughts by the thought id, as well as to get all thoughts. You can 'react' to each thought, and have the ability not just to add reactions, but to remove them as well.
